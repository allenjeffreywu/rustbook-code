// three things learned
// create new cargo project with `$ cargo new <project name>`
// build entire project with `$ cargo build`
// run entire project with `$ cargo run`

// additional note: you can check if it compiles with just `$ cargo check`
// build with optimizations for release with `$ cargo build --release` this exec will be in a new folder.
